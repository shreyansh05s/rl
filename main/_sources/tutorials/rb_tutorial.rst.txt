Using Replay Buffers
====================

**Author**: `Vincent Moens <https://github.com/vmoens>`_

.. _rb_tuto:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 11-57

Replay buffers are a central piece of any RL or control algorithm.
Supervised learning methods are usually characterized by a training loop
where data is randomly pulled from a static dataset and fed successively
to the model and loss function.
In RL, things are often slightly different: the data is gathered using the
model, then temporarily stored in a dynamic structure (the experience
replay buffer), which serves as dataset for the loss module.

As always, the context in which the buffer is used drastically conditions
how it is built: some may wish to store trajectories when others will want
to store single transitions. Specific sampling strategies may be preferable
in contexts: some items can have a higher priority than others, or it can
be important to sample with or without replacement.
Computational factors may also come into play, such as the size of the buffer
which may exceed the available RAM storage.

For these reasons, TorchRL's replay buffers are fully composable: although
they come with "batteries included", requiring a minimal effort to be built,
they also support many customizations such as storage type,
sampling strategy or data transforms.


In this tutorial, you will learn:

- How to build a :ref:`Replay Buffer (RB) <tuto_rb_vanilla>` and use it with
  any datatype;
- How to customize the :ref:`buffer's storage <tuto_rb_storage>`;
- How to use :ref:`RBs with TensorDict <tuto_rb_td>`;
- How to :ref:`sample from or iterate over a replay buffer <tuto_rb_sampling>`,
  and how to define the sampling strategy;
- How to use :ref:`prioritized replay buffers <tuto_rb_prb>`;
- How to :ref:`transform data <tuto_rb_transform>` coming in and out from
  the buffer;
- How to store :ref:`trajectories <tuto_rb_traj>` in the buffer.


Basics: building a vanilla replay buffer
----------------------------------------

.. _tuto_rb_vanilla:

TorchRL's replay buffers are designed to prioritize modularity,
composability, efficiency, and simplicity. For instance, creating a basic
replay buffer is a straightforward process, as shown in the following
example:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-66

.. code-block:: Python



    import tempfile

    from torchrl.data import ReplayBuffer

    buffer = ReplayBuffer()









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 87-91

By default, this replay buffer will have a size of 1000. Let's check this
by populating our buffer using the :meth:`~torchrl.data.ReplayBuffer.extend`
method:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 91-98

.. code-block:: Python


    print("length before adding elements:", len(buffer))

    buffer.extend(range(2000))

    print("length after adding elements:", len(buffer))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    length before adding elements: 0
    length after adding elements: 1000




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 99-146

We have used the :meth:`~torchrl.data.ReplayBuffer.extend` method which is
designed to add multiple items all at once. If the object that is passed
to ``extend`` has more than one dimension, its first dimension is
considered to be the one to be split in separate elements in the buffer.

This essentially means that when adding multidimensional tensors or
tensordicts to the buffer, the buffer will only look at the first dimension
when counting the elements it holds in memory.
If the object passed it not iterable, an exception will be thrown.

To add items one at a time, the :meth:`~torchrl.data.ReplayBuffer.add` method
should be used instead.

Customizing the storage
-----------------------

.. _tuto_rb_storage:

We see that the buffer has been capped to the first 1000 elements that we
passed to it.
To change the size, we need to customize our storage.

TorchRL proposes three types of storages:

- The :class:`~torchrl.data.ListStorage` stores elements independently in a
  list. It supports any data type, but this flexibility comes at the cost
  of efficiency;
- The :class:`~torchrl.data.LazyTensorStorage` stores tensors data
  structures contiguously.
  It works naturally with :class:`~tensordidct.TensorDict`
  (or :class:`~torchrl.data.tensorclass`)
  objects. The storage is contiguous on a per-tensor basis, meaning that
  sampling will be more efficient than when using a list, but the
  implicit restriction is that any data passed to it must have the same
  basic properties (such as shape and dtype) as the first batch of data that
  was used to instantiate the buffer.
  Passing data that does not match this requirement will either raise an
  exception or lead to some undefined behaviors.
- The :class:`~torchrl.data.LazyMemmapStorage` works as the
  :class:`~torchrl.data.LazyTensorStorage` in that it is lazy (i.e., it
  expects the first batch of data to be instantiated), and it requires data
  that match in shape and dtype for each batch stored. What makes this
  storage unique is that it points to disk files (or uses the filesystem
  storage), meaning that it can support very large datasets while still
  accessing data in a contiguous manner.

Let us see how we can use each of these storages:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 146-153

.. code-block:: Python



    from torchrl.data import LazyMemmapStorage, LazyTensorStorage, ListStorage

    # We define the maximum size of the buffer
    size = 100








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 154-156

A buffer with a list storage buffer can store any kind of data (but we must
change the ``collate_fn`` since the default expects numerical data):

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 156-160

.. code-block:: Python

    buffer_list = ReplayBuffer(storage=ListStorage(size), collate_fn=lambda x: x)
    buffer_list.extend(["a", 0, "b"])
    print(buffer_list.sample(3))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    [0, 'a', 'a']




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 161-167

Because it is the one with the lowest amount of assumption, the
:class:`~torchrl.data.ListStorage` is the default storage in TorchRL.

A :class:`~torchrl.data.LazyTensorStorage` can store data contiguously.
This should be the preferred option when dealing with complicated but
unchanging data structures of medium size:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 167-170

.. code-block:: Python


    buffer_lazytensor = ReplayBuffer(storage=LazyTensorStorage(size))








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 171-174

Let us create a batch of data of size ``torch.Size([3])`` with 2 tensors
stored in it:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 174-187

.. code-block:: Python


    import torch
    from tensordict import TensorDict

    data = TensorDict(

            ("b", "c"): torch.arange(15).view(3, 5),
        },
        batch_size=[3],
    )
    print(data)

                fields={
                    c: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([3, 5]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.int64, is_shared=False)},
                batch_size=torch.Size([3]),
                device=None,
                is_shared=False)},
        batch_size=torch.Size([3]),
        device=None,
        is_shared=False)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 188-191

The first call to :meth:`~torchrl.data.ReplayBuffer.extend` will
instantiate the storage. The first dimension of the data is unbound into
separate datapoints:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 191-195

    buffer_lazytensor.extend(data)
    print(f"The buffer has {len(buffer_lazytensor)} elements")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

    The buffer has 3 elements




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 196-198

Let us sample from the buffer, and print the data:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 198-202

.. code-block:: Python


    sample = buffer_lazytensor.sample(5)
    print("samples", sample["a"], sample["b", "c"])

A :class:`~torchrl.data.LazyMemmapStorage` is created in the same manner:

            [ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4]])




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 213-215

We can also customize the storage location on disk:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 215-226

.. code-block:: Python

    tempdir = tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()
    buffer_lazymemmap = ReplayBuffer(storage=LazyMemmapStorage(size, scratch_dir=tempdir))

    print("the 'a' tensor is stored in", buffer_lazymemmap._storage._storage["a"].filename)
    print(
        "the ('b', 'c') tensor is stored in",

Integration with TensorDict
---------------------------

.. _tuto_rb_td:

The tensor location follows the same structure as the TensorDict that
contains them: this makes it easy to save and load buffers during training.

To use :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` as a data carrier at its fullest
potential, the :class:`~torchrl.data.TensorDictReplayBuffer` class can
be used.
One of its key benefits is its ability to handle the organization of sampled
data, along with any additional information that may be required
(such as sample indices).

It can be built in the same manner as a standard
:class:`~torchrl.data.ReplayBuffer` and can
generally be used interchangeably.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 246-259

    tempdir = tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()

    )
    buffer_lazymemmap.extend(data)
    print(f"The buffer has {len(buffer_lazymemmap)} elements")
    sample = buffer_lazymemmap.sample()
    print("sample:", sample)

            b: TensorDict(
                fields={
                    c: Tensor(shape=torch.Size([12, 5]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.int64, is_shared=False)},
                batch_size=torch.Size([12]),
                device=cpu,

        is_shared=False)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 260-263

Our sample now has an extra ``"index"`` key that indicates what indices
were sampled.
Let us have a look at these indices:

Integration with tensorclass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ReplayBuffer class and associated subclasses also work natively with
:class:`~tensordict.tensorclass` classes, which can conveniently be used to
encode datasets in a more explicit manner:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 273-302

.. code-block:: Python


    from tensordict import tensorclass


    @tensorclass
    class MyData:
        images: torch.Tensor
        labels: torch.Tensor


    data = MyData(
        images=torch.randint(
            255,
            (10, 64, 64, 3),
        ),
        labels=torch.randint(100, (10,)),
        batch_size=[10],
    )

    tempdir = tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()
    buffer_lazymemmap = ReplayBuffer(
        storage=LazyMemmapStorage(size, scratch_dir=tempdir), batch_size=12
    )
    buffer_lazymemmap.extend(data)
    print(f"The buffer has {len(buffer_lazymemmap)} elements")
    sample = buffer_lazymemmap.sample()
    print("sample:", sample)






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    The buffer has 10 elements
    sample: MyData(
        images=Tensor(shape=torch.Size([12, 64, 64, 3]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.int64, is_shared=False),
        labels=Tensor(shape=torch.Size([12]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.int64, is_shared=False),
        batch_size=torch.Size([12]),
        device=cpu,
        is_shared=False)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 303-320

As expected. the data has the proper class and shape!

Integration with other tensor structures (PyTrees)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TorchRL's replay buffers also work with any pytree data structure.
A PyTree is a nested structure of arbitrary depth made of dicts, lists and/or
tuples where the leaves are tensors.
This means that one can store in contiguous memory any such tree structure!
Various storages can be used:
:class:`~torchrl.data.replay_buffers.TensorStorage`,
:class:`~torchrl.data.replay_buffers.LazyMemmapStorage`
or :class:`~torchrl.data.replay_buffers.LazyTensorStorage` all accept this
kind of data.

Here is a brief demonstration of what this feature looks like:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 320-324

.. code-block:: Python


    from torch.utils._pytree import tree_map









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 325-326

Let's build our replay buffer on disk:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 326-338

.. code-block:: Python

    rb = ReplayBuffer(storage=LazyMemmapStorage(size))
    data = {
        "a": torch.randn(3),
        "b": {"c": (torch.zeros(2), [torch.ones(1)])},
        30: -torch.ones(()),  # non-string keys also work
    }
    rb.add(data)

    # The sample has a similar structure to the data (with a leading dimension of 10 for each tensor)
    sample = rb.sample(10)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 339-340

With pytrees, any callable can be used as a transform:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 340-351

.. code-block:: Python



    def transform(x):
        # Zeros all the data in the pytree
        return tree_map(lambda y: y * 0, x)


    rb.append_transform(transform)
    sample = rb.sample(batch_size=12)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 352-353

let's check that our transform did its job:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 353-360

.. code-block:: Python

    tree_map(assert0, sample)

    {'a': None, 'b': {'c': (None, [None])}, 30: None}



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 361-387

Sampling and iterating over buffers
-----------------------------------

.. _tuto_rb_sampling:

Replay Buffers support multiple sampling strategies:

- If the batch-size is fixed and can be defined at construction time, it can
  be passed as keyword argument to the buffer;
- With a fixed batch-size, the replay buffer can be iterated over to gather
  samples;
- If the batch-size is dynamic, it can be passed to the
  :class:`~torchrl.data.ReplayBuffer.sample` method
  on-the-fly.

Sampling can be done using multithreading, but this is incompatible with the
last option (at it requires the buffer to know in advance the size of the
next batch).

Let us see a few examples:

Fixed batch-size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the batch-size is passed during construction, it should be omitted when
sampling:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 387-402

.. code-block:: Python


    data = MyData(
        images=torch.randint(
            255,
            (200, 64, 64, 3),
        ),
        labels=torch.randint(100, (200,)),
        batch_size=[200],
    )

    buffer_lazymemmap = ReplayBuffer(storage=LazyMemmapStorage(size), batch_size=128)
    buffer_lazymemmap.extend(data)
    buffer_lazymemmap.sample()






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none


    MyData(
        images=Tensor(shape=torch.Size([128, 64, 64, 3]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.int64, is_shared=False),
        labels=Tensor(shape=torch.Size([128]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.int64, is_shared=False),
        batch_size=torch.Size([128]),
        device=cpu,
        is_shared=False)



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 403-409

This batch of data has the size that we wanted it to have (128).

To enable multithreaded sampling, just pass a positive integer to the
``prefetch`` keyword argument during construction. This should speed up
sampling considerably whenever sampling is time consuming (e.g., when
using prioritized samplers):

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 409-418

.. code-block:: Python



    buffer_lazymemmap = ReplayBuffer(
        storage=LazyMemmapStorage(size), batch_size=128, prefetch=10
    )  # creates a queue of 10 elements to be prefetched in the background
    buffer_lazymemmap.extend(data)
    print(buffer_lazymemmap.sample())






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

        is_shared=False)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 419-424

Iterating over the buffer with a fixed batch-size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can also iterate over the buffer like we would do with a regular
dataloader, as long as the batch-size is predefined:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 424-432

.. code-block:: Python



    for i, data in enumerate(buffer_lazymemmap):
        if i == 3:
            print(data)
            break

        labels=Tensor(shape=torch.Size([128]), device=cpu, dtype=torch.int64, is_shared=False),
        batch_size=torch.Size([128]),
        device=cpu,
        is_shared=False)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 433-439

Due to the fact that our sampling technique is entirely random and does not
prevent replacement, the iterator in question is infinite. However, we can
make use of the
:class:`~torchrl.data.replay_buffers.SamplerWithoutReplacement`
instead, which will transform our buffer into a finite iterator:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 439-445

.. code-block:: Python

    buffer_lazymemmap = ReplayBuffer(
        storage=LazyMemmapStorage(size), batch_size=32, sampler=SamplerWithoutReplacement()
    )







.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 446-447

        },
        batch_size=[16],
    )

    buffer_lazymemmap.extend(data)
    for _i, _ in enumerate(buffer_lazymemmap):
        continue

Prioritized Replay buffers
--------------------------

.. _tuto_rb_prb:

TorchRL also provides an interface for
`prioritized replay buffers <https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952>`_.
This buffer class samples data according to a priority signal that is passed
through the data.

Although this tool is compatible with non-tensordict data, we encourage
using TensorDict instead as it makes it possible to carry meta-data in and
out from the buffer with little effort.

Let us first see how to build a prioritized replay buffer in the generic
case. The :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` hyperparameters
have to be manually set:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 494-506

.. code-block:: Python



    from torchrl.data.replay_buffers.samplers import PrioritizedSampler

    size = 100

    rb = ReplayBuffer(
        storage=ListStorage(size),
        sampler=PrioritizedSampler(max_capacity=size, alpha=0.8, beta=1.1),
        collate_fn=lambda x: x,
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 507-509

Extending the replay buffer returns the items indices, which we will need
later to update the priority:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 509-512

.. code-block:: Python


    indices = rb.extend([1, "foo", None])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 513-522

The sampler expects to have a priority for each element. When added to the
buffer, the priority is set to a default value of 1. Once the priority has
been computed (usually through the loss), it must be updated in the buffer.

This is done via the :meth:`~torchrl.data.ReplayBuffer.update_priority`
method, which requires the indices as well as the priority.
We assign an artificially high priority to the second sample in the dataset
to observe its effect on sampling:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 522-524

.. code-block:: Python

    rb.update_priority(index=indices, priority=torch.tensor([0, 1_000, 0.1]))








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 525-528

We observe that sampling from the buffer returns mostly the second sample
(``"foo"``):


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 528-532

.. code-block:: Python


    sample, info = rb.sample(10, return_info=True)
    print(sample)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    ['foo', 'foo', 'foo', 'foo', 'foo', 'foo', 'foo', 'foo', 'foo', 'foo']




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 533-534

The info contains the relative weights of the items as well as the indices.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 534-537

.. code-block:: Python

    print(info)






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    {'_weight': tensor([2.0893e-10, 2.0893e-10, 2.0893e-10, 2.0893e-10, 2.0893e-10, 2.0893e-10,
            2.0893e-10, 2.0893e-10, 2.0893e-10, 2.0893e-10]), 'index': tensor([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])}




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 538-578

We see that using a prioritized replay buffer requires a series of extra
steps in the training loop compared with a regular buffer:

- After collecting data and extending the buffer, the priority of the
  items must be updated;
- After computing the loss and getting a "priority signal" from it, we must
  update again the priority of the items in the buffer.
  This requires us to keep track of the indices.

This drastically hampers the reusability of the buffer: if one is to write
a training script where both a prioritized and a regular buffer can be
created, she must add a considerable amount of control flow to make sure
that the appropriate methods are called at the appropriate place, if and
only if a prioritized buffer is being used.

Let us see how we can improve this with :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict`.
We saw that the :class:`~torchrl.data.TensorDictReplayBuffer` returns data
augmented with their relative storage indices. One feature we did not mention
is that this class also ensures that the priority
signal is automatically parsed to the prioritized sampler if present during
extension.

The combination of these features simplifies things in several ways:
- When extending the buffer, the priority signal will automatically be
  parsed if present and the priority will accurately be assigned;
- The indices will be stored in the sampled tensordicts, making it easy to
  update the priority after the loss computation.
- When computing the loss, the priority signal will be registered in the
  tensordict passed to the loss module, making it possible to update the
  weights without effort:

  ..code - block::Python

     >>> data = replay_buffer.sample()
     >>> loss_val = loss_module(data)
     >>> replay_buffer.update_tensordict_priority(data)

The following code illustrates these concepts. We build a replay buffer with
a prioritized sampler, and indicate in the constructor the entry where
the priority signal should be fetched:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 578-587

.. code-block:: Python



    rb = TensorDictReplayBuffer(
        storage=ListStorage(size),
        sampler=PrioritizedSampler(size, alpha=0.8, beta=1.1),
        priority_key="td_error",
        batch_size=1024,
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 588-590

Let us choose a priority signal that is proportional to the storage index:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 590-596

.. code-block:: Python

    data["td_error"] = torch.arange(data.numel())

    rb.extend(data)

    sample = rb.sample()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 597-598

higher indices should occur more frequently:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 604-610

Once we have worked with our sample, we update the priority key using
the :meth:`torchrl.data.TensorDictReplayBuffer.update_tensordict_priority`
method.
For the sake of showing how this works, let us revert the priority of the
sampled items:

Using transforms
----------------

.. _tuto_rb_transform:

The data stored in a replay buffer may not be ready to be presented to a
loss module.
In some cases, the data produced by a collector can be too heavy to be
saved as-is. Examples of this include converting images from ``uint8`` to
floating point tensors, or concatenating successive frames when using
decision transformers.

Data can be processed in and out of a buffer just by appending the
appropriate transform to it.
Here are a few examples:

Saving raw images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``uint8``-typed tensors are comparatively much less memory expensive than
the floating point tensors we usually feed to our models. For this reason,
it can be useful to save the raw images.
The following script show how one can build a collector that returns only
the raw images but uses the transformed ones for inference, and how these
transformations can be recycled in the replay buffer:

We create a replay buffer with the same transform as the environment.
There is, however, a detail that needs to be addressed: transforms
used without environments are oblivious to the data structure.
When appending a transform to an environment, the data in the ``"next"``
nested tensordict is transformed first and then copied at the root during
the rollout execution. When working with static data, this is not the case.
Nevertheless, our data comes with a nested "next" tensordict that will be
ignored by our transform if we don't explicitly instruct it to take care of
it. We manually add these keys to the transform:

A more complex examples: using CatFrames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.CatFrames` transform unfolds the observations
through time, creating a n-back memory of past events that allow the model
to take the past events into account (in the case of POMDPs or with
recurrent policies such as Decision Transformers). Storing these concatenated
frames can consume a considerable amount of memory. It can also be
problematic when the n-back window needs to be different (usually longer)
during training and inference. We solve this problem by executing the
``CatFrames`` transform separately in the two phases.

Storing trajectories
--------------------

.. _tuto_rb_traj:

In many cases, it is desirable to access trajectories from the buffer rather
than simple transitions. TorchRL offers multiple ways of achieving this.

The preferred way is currently to store trajectories along the first
dimension of the buffer and use a :class:`~torchrl.data.SliceSampler` to
sample these batches of data. This class only needs a couple of information
about your data structure to do its job (not that as of now it is only
compatible with tensordict-structured data): the number of slices or their
length and some information about where the separation between the
episodes can be found (e.g. :ref:`recall that <gs_storage_collector>` with a
:ref:`DataCollector <collectors>`, the trajectory id is stored in
``("collector", "traj_ids")``). In this simple example, we construct a data
with 4 consecutive short trajectories and sample 4 slices out of it, each of
length 2 (since the batch size is 8, and 8 items // 4 slices = 2 time steps).
We mark the steps as well.

.. code-block:: Python


    from torchrl.data import SliceSampler

    rb = TensorDictReplayBuffer(
        storage=LazyMemmapStorage(size),
        sampler=SliceSampler(traj_key="episode", num_slices=4),
        batch_size=8,
    )
    episode = torch.zeros(10, dtype=torch.int)
    episode[:3] = 1
    episode[3:5] = 2
    episode[5:7] = 3
    episode[7:] = 4
    steps = torch.cat([torch.arange(3), torch.arange(2), torch.arange(2), torch.arange(3)])
    data = TensorDict(
        {
            "episode": episode,
            "obs": torch.randn((3, 4, 5)).expand(10, 3, 4, 5),
            "act": torch.randn((20,)).expand(10, 20),
            "other": torch.randn((20, 50)).expand(10, 20, 50),

        },

Conclusion
----------

We have seen how a replay buffer can be used in TorchRL, from its simplest
usage to more advanced ones where the data need to be transformed or stored
in particular ways.
You should now be able to:

- Create a Replay Buffer, customize its storage, sampler and transforms;
- Choose the best storage type for your problem (list, memory or disk-based);
- Minimize the memory footprint of your buffer.

Next steps
----------

- Check the data API reference to learn about offline datasets in TorchRL,
  which are based on our Replay Buffer API;
- Check other samplers such as
  :class:`~torchrl.data.SamplerWithoutReplacement`,
  :class:`~torchrl.data.PrioritizedSliceSampler` and
  :class:`~torchrl.data.SliceSamplerWithoutReplacement`, or other writers
  such as :class:`~torchrl.data.TensorDictMaxValueWriter`.
- Check how to checkpoint ReplayBuffers in :ref:`the doc <checkpoint-rb>`.
